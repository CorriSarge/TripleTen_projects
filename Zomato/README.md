### Data
TripleTen provided an archived file of 5 seperate excel files from the mock company Zomato. I used 3 for this project.
- `'Zomato data.zip'`: Compressed exel files provided by team lead
    - `'orders'`: All orders made from the menu by all customers at all restaurants between Oct. 4th 2017 and June 26th 2020.
    - `'users'`: All customers who completed orders during the designated time frame and their demographic information.
    - `'restaurants'`: ALL restaurants that have received orders on the Zomato app with their cuisines, customer rating, and order information.

### Description:
- This was a Customer Segmentation Analysis.
- 11 charts, 6 Dashboards and 1 Story on Tableau.
- Includes charts on different customer segmentation and Dashboards to look up specific information on different customer segments.
- Purpose was to successfully complete the Zomato onboarding project to showcase analytical skills to the mock company.

### Assumptions:
- The provided test datasets are accurate, complete, and consistent.
- Missing values or inconsistencies are minimal and will not significantly impact the analysis.
- The column descriptions accurately reflect the content of each table.
- The provided tables (orders, users, and restaurants) contain all the necessary information for the chosen analysis.
- Zomato's business context and industry trends are considered while interpreting the data.

### Process:
I first learned of the problem presented in it's intirety and it's requirements for approval.
Then, I chose software and created my first submission, the "Decomposition Plan".
After, I analyzed the data, created visualizations and dashboards, created and recorder video presentation, and written analysis for submission and approval on first submission. 

### Findings:
1. Most popular age range is 21-24 year olds.
2. Majority of users are men.
3. Most users are un-married and have no income due to the occupation being students.
4. Weekdays are the most popular times to order.
5. Reviews and ratings for restaurants have no impact on orders placed.
