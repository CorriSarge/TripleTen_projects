This was my first project I worked on in the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics Program. It was an independent project designed to showcase what I have learned for Advanced Spreadsheets.

### Data
The data was one Google spreadsheet file provided by TripleTen:
- `'nyc_airbnb_data.csv'`: each row corresponds to one listing on AirBnB in September 2022
    - `'data_dictionary'`: summary of field titles seen in file and it's data type
    - `'listings'`: uniquely listings available with all available data
    - `'calendar'`: listings with upcoming availabilities and date type data

### Description:
- 14 page spreadsheet
- Includes raw data, processed data, data analysis, pivot tables, executive summary, and change log.
- Purpose was to determine what types of properties should be targeted for the vacation rental market, in the Manhattan borough of New York City based on available AirBnB data.

### Assumptions:
- Airbnb rentals are equivalent to the general vacation rental statistics.	
- Super luxury listings with prices higher than $200 more than the average nightly rate.
- Revews during the last twelve months were used to determine how often a listing was rented in the last year.
- Properties with fewer than 1 reviews were considered in active.

### Process:
I first explored, filtered, and cleaned the data.
Then I created aggregations and pivot tables to determine the type of properties that should be targeted.
I performed calculations, pivot tables and charts to determine occupancy and estimated revenue.
Lastly I finalized formatting for the client's readability.

### Findings:
1. The top 10 attractive neighborhoods for vacation rentals are as follows: Hell's Kitchen, Lower East Side, Harlem, Midtown, Upper West Side, Chelsea, East Village, East Harlem, West Village, Nolita.			
2. The most popular vacation rental size is 1 bedroom overall. Lower East Side has the largest 1 bedroom demand. 2 bedrooms in Hell's Kitchen and Studioâ€™s in Midtown are also desirable.			
3. Friday's have the highest occupancy day of the week. Saturday is a very close second. 			
4. Recommended to purchase a 1 bedroom in the East Village for a vacation rental. 			
5. Estimated income is $81,686 for a 1 bedroom rental in the East Village.
